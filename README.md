Jason's "Getting Off Relay" workflow
This was originally designed by @Jason on Discord to help people work through getting their miner off relay.  It was a giant image and intimidating to most, as well as sometimes being hard to read.  With Jason's permission I hired someone on Upwork to make it a little easier to digest a step at a time.  The HTML from that is here.
